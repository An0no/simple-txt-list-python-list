# TXT to Python List Converter
This is a simple Python script that converts a list of items in a plain text file into a Python list. It can be useful if you have a large list of items that you want to use in your Python code, but you don't want to manually type out each item.

## How to Use
Save your list of items in a plain text file. Each item should be on a new line.
Download or clone this repository.
Open txt_to_list_converter.py in your preferred text editor or IDE.
Update the file path to your plain text file in the txt_file variable.
Run the script.
The resulting Python list will be printed in the console.

## Example
Input text file (items.txt):
```
apple
banana
cherry

```
Output Python list:
```
['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
```
